# Flashcard Learning App

## Description
This project is a flashcard learning application built using Python's tkinter module. It helps users learn French vocabulary by displaying French words and their English translations. The app allows users to mark words as known or unknown, and saves this information for future reference.

# Features
Flashcard Display: Shows French words on flashcards, which flip to reveal the English translation after a short delay.

Known/Unknown Tracking: Users can mark words as known or unknown, and the app tracks these selections.

Data Persistence: Saves known and unknown words to separate CSV files for future reference.

User Interface: A simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction.

## How to Use
Start the App: Run the application to display the main window.

View Flashcards: Press any button to start viewing flashcards. The French word will be displayed first, followed by the English translation after a short delay.

Mark Words: Use the right button to mark a word as known and the wrong button to mark it as unknown.

Save Progress: The app automatically saves your progress to CSV files when you close the application.
